# FOREWORD TO THE SIXTH EDITION

FATHER LEONARD FOLEY'S BELIEVING IN JESUS HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME, being widely used in RCIA programs, in schools and by individuals wanting a comprehensive presentation of the Catholic faith. He was preparing its third edition when he died in 1994. To keep current with church documents and events, Pat McCloskey <sub>O.F.M.</sub>, (editor, *St. Anthony Messenger* magazine), Lisa Biedenbach (editorial director, books, St. Anthony Messenger Press) and Jeremy Harrington <sub>O.F.M.</sub> (former publisher, St. Anthony Messenger Press) prepared the fourth edition in 2000. One major change was to place the Discussion/Reflection Starters within the text and to expand Appendix B (print, video and audio resources useful in conjunction with *Believing in Jesus*). Pat has prepared the fifth and sixth editions, mostly updating the recommended resources. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May all who read this book come to know, love and follow Jesus as deeply, intensely and generously as Leonard Foley did.
